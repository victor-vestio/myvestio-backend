# Invoice Module Postman Testing Guide

This guide covers testing all invoice routes with Postman, including detailed explanations of Redis caching and Cloudinary document management integration.

## üîß Setup Prerequisites

### Environment Variables
Create a Postman environment with these variables:
```
BASE_URL = http://localhost:3000/api
SELLER_TOKEN = (JWT token for seller user)
ANCHOR_TOKEN = (JWT token for anchor user)
ADMIN_TOKEN = (JWT token for admin user)
LENDER_TOKEN = (JWT token for lender user)
INVOICE_ID = (will be set dynamically)
```

### Headers Template
For all authenticated requests, add:
```
Authorization: Bearer {{SELLER_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
```

## üìä Redis & Cloudinary Integration Details

### **Redis Usage Patterns:**

1. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Invoice details cached for 30 minutes
   - Search results cached for 5-10 minutes
   - Marketplace data cached for 5 minutes
   - Analytics cached for 1 hour

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Status changes published to channels
   - User-specific notifications
   - Marketplace updates for new listings

3. **Metrics Tracking:**
   - Daily submission counts
   - Processing time calculations
   - Trending invoice views
   - Status transition analytics

4. **Distributed Locking:**
   - Prevents concurrent invoice modifications
   - Ensures data consistency during status changes

### **Cloudinary Integration:**

1. **Document Security:**
   - Token-based access control
   - Backup enabled for compliance
   - Folder organization by seller/invoice

2. **Image Processing:**
   - Automatic thumbnail generation
   - Preview URLs for marketplace
   - Watermarking for different statuses

3. **Access Control:**
   - Draft: Restricted access
   - Submitted: Under review tags
   - Listed: Marketplace accessible
   - Funded: Active status tags

4. **Compliance Features:**
   - 7-year retention policy
   - Audit trail with metadata
   - Secure signed URLs with expiration

## üß™ Postman Collection Setup

### **Pre-request Scripts** (Add to Collection level):
```javascript
// Auto-refresh tokens if needed
if (!pm.environment.get("SELLER_TOKEN")) {
    console.log("Please set authentication tokens in environment");
}
```

### **Test Scripts** (Add to Collection level):
```javascript
// Log response times for performance monitoring
pm.test("Response time is acceptable", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(2000);
});

// Check for proper error handling
if (pm.response.code >= 400) {
    pm.test("Error response has proper structure", function () {
        const response = pm.response.json();
        pm.expect(response).to.have.property("success", false);
        pm.expect(response).to.have.property("message");
    });
}
```

### **Environment Variables to Set:**
```
BASE_URL = http://localhost:3000/api
SELLER_TOKEN = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
ANCHOR_TOKEN = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
ADMIN_TOKEN = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
LENDER_TOKEN = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
ANCHOR_USER_ID = (MongoDB ObjectId of anchor user)
```

Remember to follow the testing order as invoice status flows are sequential: DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí ANCHOR_APPROVED ‚Üí ADMIN_VERIFIED ‚Üí LISTED ‚Üí (FUNDED when offers implemented).
